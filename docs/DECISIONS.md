## [2026-05-01] Engine 2.1.0: name-based category inference fallback

**Tier:** 1
**Context:** When OFF returns `categories_tags: []` and the LLM is
unsure (or not called), `ProductInput.category` falls through to
`'other'`. The `'other'` row in `CATEGORY_THRESHOLDS` carries the
generic `[3, 6, 12]` protein scale and `[1.5, 3, 6]` fiber scale,
which punishes products whose name alone makes their category
obvious — "Yaourt grec nature" silently lost ~3 points on pillar 2
(nutritional density) because it was judged against generic
thresholds instead of yogurt's `[3, 5, 9]` protein / `[0, 1, 2]`
fiber scale.
**Options considered:**
  - Plumb name-inference into `off.ts` AND `ocr-parser.ts` separately
    — pro: signal lives close to the source. Con: two regex tables to
    keep in lockstep + neither catches user-typed names from the
    quick-add path.
  - Add a final-fallback in `scoreProduct` itself — pro: every input
    flows through one place, regardless of source. Con: scoring layer
    learns about names, which it didn't before.
  - Do nothing — pro: simpler. Con: silent score drag on the long
    tail of OFF products with empty `categories_tags`.
**Decision:** New `inferCategoryFromName()` export + final-fallback in
`scoreProduct`. Fires only when `category === 'other'`. Surfaces a
warning so the audit reflects that inference happened.
**Rationale:** Engine sees every input regardless of source, including
hand-typed Quick Add names. One regex table in one place. The warning
preserves provenance ("we did this, not the LLM"). Scoring math is
unchanged for any input that already had a non-`other` category.
**Reversal cost:** Trivial — delete the function + the
`applyCategoryInference` call site, drop the test file.
**Revisit trigger:** First report of a name being mis-categorised.
The `NAME_CATEGORY_PATTERNS` table is a pure data list; one PR adds
or removes an entry.
**Engine bump:** 2.0.0 → 2.1.0 (per ADR-0006: minor = new bonus /
penalty / threshold path; products' scores may shift ±1–3 points
when inference fires, but only for inputs that were previously
falling through to the generic 'other' scale).

## [2026-04-22] Empirical pairing source: Ahn 2011 recipe-corpus (s3), not molecular-compound backbone (s2)

**Tier:** 2
**Context:** First-cut `pairings.js` was hand-written from memory with an
incorrect "Sourced from Larousse" claim. Needed a real source that also
produced useful output.
**Options considered:**
  - Ahn 2011 backbone (s2 molecular-similarity CSV) — pro: the paper's headline
    structure. Con: dominated by alcoholic beverages, poor fit for Mediterranean
    home cooking (paper itself documents this in §3).
  - Ahn 2011 recipe corpus (s3 CSV of 56,498 published recipes) — pro: empirical
    co-occurrence in actual cookbooks; produces "tomate → basilic" as expected.
    Con: larger data, cuisine-biased toward US/Italian.
  - Licensed databases (Foodpairing, Flavor Network commercial) — rejected:
    licensing not established; cost unknown.
**Decision:** s3 recipe corpus with PPMI × √count scoring.
**Rationale:** Peer-reviewed, open-access, and produces culinarily-meaningful
output. PPMI suppresses ubiquitous staples; √count prefers well-evidenced
pairs.
**Reversal cost:** Low — `tools/generate-pairings.mjs` could be re-pointed at
a different input file.
**Revisit trigger:** If Foodpairing / Larousse commercial API becomes accessible
with a defensible licence.

## [2026-04-22] IDB schema v6: add `activity` store for exercise logging

**Tier:** 2
**Context:** Exercise logging (#1) needed a new persisted store alongside
`consumption`, `weight`, `recipes`, etc.
**Options considered:**
  - New store in IDB — pro: same persistence layer as everything else, works
    offline, backup/restore covers it. Con: coordinated DB_VERSION bump across
    7 sibling modules that all share `scanneat` DB.
  - localStorage — pro: no migration. Con: no indexing, size-limited, at odds
    with the rest of the data model.
**Decision:** IDB v6 bump, new `activity` store with date index.
**Rationale:** Consistent with every other time-series data in the app.
**Reversal cost:** Low if caught early; medium once users have data (would
need a v6 → v7 dropping the store and migrating to localStorage).
**Revisit trigger:** If IDB quota becomes a problem on low-end devices.

## [2026-04-22] LLM provider: Groq (Llama 4 Scout)

**Tier:** 2
**Context:** Need a vision-capable LLM for label OCR + food photo
identification + recipe suggestion. Two call modes needed: server-key (Vercel
env) and direct (user's key in the browser).
**Options considered:**
  - Groq `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct` — pro: generous free
    tier, low latency, OpenAI-compatible API, vision + text. Con: newer model,
    less battle-tested than GPT-4o.
  - OpenAI GPT-4o / Anthropic Claude — pro: incumbent, robust. Con: no free
    tier; user-key direct-mode would push costs to the end user immediately.
**Decision:** Groq with option for either server or direct-mode keys.
**Rationale:** Free tier keeps low-traffic deployments at $0; user-key path
puts cost visibility in the user's hands.
**Reversal cost:** Low — `ocr-parser.ts` has one `callGroqVision` helper. A
swap to another OpenAI-compatible endpoint is a URL + model-name change.
**Revisit trigger:** If Groq's free tier terms change materially or if scout
model quality issues accumulate in production.

## [2026-04-22] Pantry search as a new endpoint vs. overloading suggestRecipes

**Tier:** 1
**Context:** #B3.2 needed ingredient-first recipe search. Existing
`suggestRecipes(ingredient)` accepted a single ingredient string.
**Options considered:**
  - Overload `suggestRecipes` to accept `string | string[]`. Pro: one endpoint.
    Con: two very different prompt shapes get tangled; callers have to discriminate.
  - New `suggestRecipesFromPantry(items)` + `/api/suggest-from-pantry`. Pro:
    clean separation, each prompt tuned for its task.
**Decision:** Separate function + endpoint.
**Rationale:** Prompts for the two tasks are meaningfully different —
pantry-first tells the model to USE the listed items + staples; single-
ingredient tells it to center AROUND the ingredient. Separation keeps prompt
regression bisectable.
**Reversal cost:** Trivial.
**Revisit trigger:** None expected.

## [2026-04-22] Dashboard gap-closer uses PPMI-like density ranking, half-deficit targeting

**Tier:** 1
**Context:** B4.1. Given today's gap in a "more is better" nutrient, rank
FOOD_DB suggestions by their capacity to close it.
**Options considered:**
  - Close 100% of the gap — honest math but implies "you must eat 280 g of
    lentils". Not friendly.
  - Close ~50% of the gap, sort by per-100 g density, cap grams per nutrient —
    nudges the user toward the most nutritious option at a realistic portion.
  - LLM-generated suggestions — would be opinionated but slow and requires a
    round trip for every dashboard render.
**Decision:** Half-gap heuristic, density-sorted, grams cap.
**Rationale:** Fast (pure function), honest (the math is documented in the
function header), and user-friendly.
**Reversal cost:** Trivial — `closeTheGap()` is one pure function.
**Revisit trigger:** User feedback that suggestions feel unrealistic.

## [2026-04-22] Meal plan in localStorage, not IDB

**Tier:** 1
**Context:** B4.2 — forward-looking 7-day meal plan.
**Options considered:**
  - IDB store (another DB_VERSION bump and migration).
  - localStorage at `scanneat.mealPlan`, auto-pruning dates older than 7
    days.
**Decision:** localStorage.
**Rationale:** Tiny dataset (max 7 days × 4 meals × small slot objects).
Auto-pruning keeps it below 2 KB. Avoids yet another IDB migration. Falls
through backup.js's scanneat.* sweep automatically.
**Reversal cost:** Low — migration to IDB would read the localStorage key
once and write to a new store.
**Revisit trigger:** If users ask for longer-horizon plans or cross-device
sync (which would need a server anyway).

## [2026-04-22] CSV import schemas: MyFitnessPal + Cronometer only (v1)

**Tier:** 1
**Context:** B8.2 — import historical entries from other nutrition apps.
**Options considered:**
  - Support 5-10 formats (MFP, Cronometer, Lose It, Yazio, FDDB, etc.).
  - Support 2 now (MFP + Cronometer), document the detector, let the community
    add more via PRs.
**Decision:** 2 now.
**Rationale:** MFP + Cronometer cover ~80% of serious logged-history users.
The `detectFormat(header)` pattern is extensible — a contributor adds a new
detector arm + mapper function; no schema change. Shipping more formats
without a real user who has that file is speculative.
**Reversal cost:** Trivial.
**Revisit trigger:** Any user lands with a Yazio / Lose It / Fatsecret export.

## [2026-04-22] A11y baseline: skip link + focus-visible + live regions already in place; only dashboard-remaining was missing

**Tier:** 1
**Context:** B7.2 WCAG audit. Most of the surface was already correct
(`.skip-link`, `focus-visible` rules, `aria-live` on toasts + camera + day
note counter).
**Options considered:**
  - Deep per-axe violation sweep — would need axe-core or playwright.
  - Spot audit + fix the most impactful gap (dashboard-remaining, the
    biggest runtime update a screen reader should hear).
**Decision:** Spot audit + targeted fix.
**Rationale:** Deep sweep without real screen-reader testing is theatre.
The existing infrastructure is solid; incremental attention is where the
remaining wins are.
**Reversal cost:** N/A — additive change.
**Revisit trigger:** First user report, or any new dialog / high-traffic
dynamic region that ships without explicit aria wiring.

## [2026-04-22] Fix presenter-tests hang: add `g` flag to portion regex in `parseVoiceQuickAdd`

**Tier:** 1
**Context:** B6.1. `presenter-tests.ts` had been silently hanging for weeks.
Root cause: `while ((m = portionRe.exec(text)) !== null)` with a regex that
didn't carry the `g` flag, so `.exec()` never advanced `lastIndex` — a
`continue` inside the loop hit the same match forever.
**Options considered:**
  - Rewrite the loop to manually track `lastIndex` — not idiomatic.
  - Add `g` flag to the RegExp constructor — the idiomatic fix.
  - Replace the loop with a single `matchAll` — also valid; more invasive.
**Decision:** Add `g` flag + inline comment + also accept "of" alongside
"de" in the macro-label regexes (fixed the EN-vocabulary test that had been
failing).
**Rationale:** Smallest intervention; documented so next maintainer can't
accidentally drop the flag.
**Reversal cost:** N/A.
**Revisit trigger:** Any future regex constructed in a `.exec()` loop should
follow the same pattern (noted in the header comment).

## [2026-04-22] Allergens audit: `ANNEX_II_KEYS` exported + two plural-form bugs fixed

**Tier:** 1
**Context:** B7.1. Audit found the 14 EU Annex II keys were correctly
listed, but the crustaceans + molluscs regexes only matched singular forms —
a silent-miss safety bug.
**Options considered:**
  - Rewrite every regex to include plurals via a generated suffix.
  - Spot-fix the two confirmed bugs + add structural test pinning the 14 keys.
**Decision:** Spot-fix + pin.
**Rationale:** Every rule now has a positive-example test; the structural test
pins ANNEX_II_KEYS so a future rename/drop fails CI.
**Reversal cost:** N/A.
**Revisit trigger:** If a user reports missed allergens on a specific product.

## [2026-04-24] Audit-v3 Bucket 3 decisions (F-N-03, F-DRC-02, F-CS-06)

The audit (docs/audit-v3/SUMMARY.md) surfaced three questions that
needed product-owner input. In the absence of that input, the fix
pass made conservative defaults and landed them as committed
decisions:

### F-N-03 — ES / IT / DE beta locales

**Tier:** 2
**Context:** Three locales ship with ~20-key skeletons (2.9% coverage
vs FR/EN). Audit options were: expand to 20-30%, prune from picker,
or defer.
**Decision:** **Defer (current state preserved).** The language-picker
already labels them "(partiel · EN fallback)" and the t() fallback
chain (Batch 1 made FR the final fallback) guarantees users always
see a real translation. Users who opt in are explicitly warned.
**Rationale:** Pruning retires capability with no offsetting gain.
Expanding to 20-30% is real translation work without evidence of
ES/IT/DE demand.
**Reversal cost:** Low. Picker change is 4 lines; expansion is
mechanical copy work.
**Revisit trigger:** Any user support ticket from an ES/IT/DE user;
any marketing push in a Romance-language region.

### F-DRC-02 — tablet layout

**Tier:** 1
**Context:** Breakpoints jump 540 px → 1024 px with no tablet band,
so iPad portrait (768) gets the phone CSS.
**Decision:** **No dedicated tablet layout.** PRD brief targets
"$200 Android" phones; PWA/APK distribution only. Tablets use
whichever side's rules fit their viewport.
**Rationale:** Brief does not call out tablets. Adding a 720–1023 px
band now is speculative scaffolding.
**Mitigation:** Batch 16 (F-DRC-04) added `max-height: 500px`
overrides so landscape phones (and by extension short-height tablet
browser windows) don't lose the action row below the fold.
**Reversal cost:** Medium — requires real tablet testing.
**Revisit trigger:** First user complaint from an iPad; any Play
Store submission that requires tablet-optimised screenshots.

### F-CS-06 — farmer's-market metaphor granularity

**Tier:** 1
**Context:** Character-brief vision "scientist's notebook at a
farmer's market" is partially realized (strong notebook; weak market).
**Decision:** **Preserve the metaphor as-is; do not retire the
market half.** No new market-specific signature elements land in
audit-v3.
**Rationale:** Without an owner's design direction, adding
receipt-tape separators / handwritten stamps / paper-tag badges
would just accumulate cruft. The current coral warmth + scrapbook
tilts already earn the "market" half indirectly.
**Reversal cost:** N/A (additive design decision).
**Revisit trigger:** A design sprint where the owner wants to
strengthen brand distinctiveness; any feature that naturally suits
a market-stall treatment (e.g., a pantry-tile UI with "produce
crate" visual cues).
