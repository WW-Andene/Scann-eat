# Scan'eat

A PWA for French-speaking users that scans food products + food photos, scores
them against the user's diet / allergen / health profile, and tracks the day's
intake against EFSA / WHO targets.

> **Status**: pre-1.0. Data is stored locally only. No account system. No
> cloud sync. See [docs/00-brief.md](docs/00-brief.md) for the full product
> brief and [docs/DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md) for the architecture

## Architecture

- **Runtime**: Vanilla ES modules. No React / Vue / Svelte.
- **Shell**: PWA under `public/`. Service Worker: stale-while-revalidate + `share_target`.
- **Persistence**: IndexedDB (v6, 7 stores) + `localStorage` for settings, snapshots, and
  small feature state (meal plan, fasting, hydration, per-day notes, custom foods).
- **External APIs**: Open Food Facts (barcode product lookup); Groq (Llama 4 Scout —
  label OCR, food photo ID, menu scan, recipe suggestions). Groq runs in
  **server mode** (deployer's API key in Vercel env) or **direct mode** (user's
  key in the browser; no money flows through the deployer).
- **Native wrap**: Capacitor 6 (Android only) — see `.github/workflows/android.yml`
  for the APK build path.
- **Tests**: `node --test --experimental-strip-types` on ~20 `*-tests.ts` files.
  449 tests at the time of writing.

## Getting started

### Local dev

```bash
# requires Node 22+ (for --experimental-strip-types)
npm install
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_… npm run dev     # serves public/ on :3000 + /api/* routes
npm test                            # full suite (~1s)
npm run build:web                   # regenerates public/engine.bundle.js + SW cache key
```

### Deploying the web shell

Vercel deployment picks up `api/*.ts` as serverless functions and serves
`public/` statically. `GROQ_API_KEY` must be set as a project env var for
server mode to work; otherwise the app remains functional in direct mode
(user pastes their Groq key in Settings).

### Android APK

`.github/workflows/android.yml` runs `cap sync android` + Gradle build on
push. Artifacts are uploaded to the workflow run. See the workflow file for
signing details.

## Data + provenance

Every data file in the repo cites its source. See [docs/00-brief.md](docs/00-brief.md#data-sources--provenance)
for the full table. Highlights:

| File | Source |
|------|--------|
| `public/data/food-db.js` | ANSES CIQUAL 2020 (hand-transcribed; `tools/generate-food-db.mjs` for bit-for-bit regen) |
| `public/data/pairings.js` | Ahn et al., *Scientific Reports* 1:196 (2011), DOI 10.1038/srep00196 |
| `public/data/activity.js` (MET) | Ainsworth 2011 Compendium of Physical Activities |
| `public/data/profile.js` (targets) | EFSA PRI + WHO guidelines |
| `public/core/allergens.js` | EU Regulation 1169/2011 Annex II (list is regulatory; detection regexes are editorial) |
| Label / food ID | Groq Llama 4 Scout via `api/identify*.ts` |

## Versioning

SemVer. Currently **v0.2.0** (pre-1.0). Backwards-incompatible changes bump
the minor until 1.0 ships. Each feature-complete batch lands with a commit
tagged `B<n>.<m>` in the message.

Cache invalidation for the PWA shell is **automatic** — `build.mjs` sets the
service-worker cache key to the current commit SHA, so users on an old
shell get a clean update on next load.

## License

**Licensing decision pending** — see `LICENSE.TODO` for the open question.
Until resolved, redistribution / derivative works / commercial use are not
authorised by default. Open an issue or contact the owner.

---

## Privacy

See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md). One-line summary: all user data stays on the
device unless the deployer explicitly configures server-mode Groq, in which
case label photos and food photos are sent to Groq for identification. No
other third party receives user content.

---

## Contributing

Small, focused pull requests welcome. Each feature should land with tests in
a dedicated `*-tests.ts` file following the existing naming convention. Do
not extend `presenter-tests.ts` — it already covers the bulk of
`public/core/presenters.js` and new features should live in their own file.

Provenance rules:

- Every piece of data shipped in the repo must cite its source.
- Hand-transcribed approximations are allowed if the header clearly flags
  them as such + points to a generator that produces the authoritative form.
- Regex rules (allergens, diets) are editorial; document that in-file.

Run the full suite before opening a PR:

```bash
npm run build:web && npm test
